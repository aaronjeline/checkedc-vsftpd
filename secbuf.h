 * PURPOSE
 * Allocate a "secure buffer". A secure buffer is one which will attempt to
 * catch out of bounds accesses by crashing the program (rather than
 * corrupting memory). It works by using UNIX memory protection. It isn't
 * foolproof.
 * PARAMETERS
 * p_ptr        - pointer to a pointer which is to contain the secure buffer.
 *                Any previous buffer pointed to is freed.
 * size         - size in bytes required for the secure buffer.

 *                buffer pointer is nullified by this call.
